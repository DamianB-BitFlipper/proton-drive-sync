## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it privately using
this repository's GitHub Security Advisories feature ("Security" tab → "Report a vulnerability").

When reporting, please include, at a minimum:
- A description of the issue and its potential impact
- Steps to reproduce (including any required configuration or data)
- The version(s) of the project you tested, and your environment (OS, language/runtime, etc.)
- Any relevant logs, proof-of-concept code, or screenshots

We will acknowledge new reports within 5 business days and aim to provide an initial triage
(including a severity assessment and next steps) within 10 business days. While a fix or
mitigation is being developed, we will provide status updates at least every 14 days to the
original reporter. If the vulnerability is confirmed, we will work with you on coordinated
disclosure; if it is not accepted as a vulnerability, we will explain the reasons for that
decision.
